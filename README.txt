== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= How do I configure "no more 404"? =

"no more 404" doesn't need any configuration at the moment. It simply does what it is supposed to.

= Why some redirections seem to take too long? =

For some blogs with more than 10000 articles for example, it could take a little bit to search on that larger sitemap.xml the appropiate match for the request.
To avoid a delay you may either cache your sitemap.xml (e.g. through varnish) or put a static sitemap.xml in your document-root.
